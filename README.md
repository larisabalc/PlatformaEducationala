# ðŸŽ“ Educational Platform Management Application

## Overview
This C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application, using SQL Server 2019 or newer, is designed to manage an educational platform for a school. The application is structured on the MVVM model, utilizing Entity Framework for database operations, and supports four types of users: administrators, teachers, form masters, and students.

### Key Features:
- **Database Normalization:** The database is normalized to the third normal form (3NF) to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Stored Procedures:** The application includes stored procedures to streamline database interactions.
- **Layered Architecture:** The application is structured on multiple layers to promote separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Parameterized queries are used to prevent SQL injection attacks, ensuring secure database operations.
- **MVVM and Data Binding:** The application strictly follows the MVVM pattern and utilizes data binding for dynamic and responsive UI updates.
- **Entity Framework:** Leveraged for efficient and simplified database operations, reducing the complexity of data access code.
